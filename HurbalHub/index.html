The need for precise plant identification and effective information exchange has been highlighted by the rise in popularity of natural and plant-based therapies in recent years. However, identification is challenging and there is a greater chance of incorrect classification and ineffective or dangerous treatments due to the breadth of natural environments and morphologies observed in medicinal plants. Furthermore, appropriate knowledge sharing regarding medicinal plants is essential to the development of research, conservation, and safe usage practices. However, the scattered nature of data sources and the lack of centralized, standardized databases significantly hinder efficient knowledge sharing among stakeholders.</p>

                  <br>The following areas are the research gaps found in most of the recent research.
                  <br/><br>
1.	Improving Medicinal Plant Identification Through Automation: Compared to manual identification, automated techniques expedite medicinal plant identification, increasing its speed and accuracy. This helps guarantee the dependability of plant-based treatments by lowering reliance on specialists and minimizing human error.
<br/><br>
2.	Identification Challenges for Non-Professionals: Farmers and herbalists are examples of non-professionals who frequently lack the equipment and knowledge necessary for precise plant identification. Without the right assistance, they run the risk of being misidentified, which could result in toxic or ineffectual herbal remedies.
<br/><br>
3.	The Function of Image Recognition in Plant Identification: By examining photographs, image recognition technology makes it possible to accurately identify different plant species. For people without specific botanical knowledge, it enhances accessibility by using algorithms to identify and categorize plant traits.
<br/><br>
4.	Using Technology to Increase Identification Accuracy: Plant identification systems are more reliable when technology, such as artificial intelligence, and machine learning, is integrated. By utilizing multi-modal data, these systems improve accuracy and enable safe data exchange and collaborative study.
<br/><br>
5.	Deep Learning Models for Increased Accuracy: Deep learning models are excellent at managing intricate, varied datasets, which increases the efficiency and accuracy of identification. They must be able to adjust to different plant morphologies to develop a reliable identification system.
<br/><br>
6.	6. Advantages of Automated Plant Identification in Herbal Medicine: This dependable instrument enables non-experts to make knowledgeable selections regarding herbal remedies. This promotes conservation and safety in herbal medicine while also assisting in the sustainable use of medicinal herbs. </p>

                    <br/><br>
                    Accurate identification and authentication of medicinal plant species are essential for the long-term viability and safety of herbal treatments. Conventional plant identification methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human mistakes since they rely on professional manual observation. This is a serious obstacle to the development of herbal medicine and prevents the use of therapeutic plants in healthcare [1].
                    </br>
                  <br>
                  It is especially problematic when non-professionals, such as farmers, herbalists, and local populations, collect and use medicinal plants; in these cases, a rapid and accurate identification mechanism is lacking. This discrepancy raises questions regarding overharvesting and inaccurate plant species identification, which could jeopardize the security and effectiveness of herbal therapies as treatments [2]. 
                  </br>
                  <br>The creation of an automated method for the Integrated Solutions for Advanced Medicinal Plant Identification and Information Sharing of the medicinal plant species from photos is necessary to overcome these difficulties. Utilizing state-of-the-art image recognition technology, particularly deep learning models, is a viable way to improve and expedite the identification process [3]. 
                  </br>
                  <br>
                 Modern technology becomes a vital step forward when it is integrated, as it reduces the drawbacks of manual identification and makes the process of identifying medicinal plant species easier to access and more effective [4]. 
The goal of this research project is to close the current gap in automated medicinal plant species identification from photographs by developing a dependable and intuitive solution. The implementation of deep learning models is expected to facilitate the creation of a resilient system that can manage heterogeneous datasets and yield precise identification outcomes [5]. With the ability to identify medicinal plant species, such a solution has the potential to empower non-professionals confidently and reliably in the field of herbal medicine and promote the informed and sustainable use of herbal resources for healthcare.
